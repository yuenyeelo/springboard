A Recommender system helps to personalize a platform and help users find what they are looking for. From a business perspective, the more relevant content or movies a user finds on any particular platform, the higher their engagement and as a result increased revenue.

Recommendation systems for the entertainment industry have become popular in recent years, such as Youtube, Netflix and Spotify are using different approaches to recommend video or music to users. A good recommendation system is able to ensure high-quality recommendations according to the user's taste.

 The goal of The Million Song Dataset Challenge is to predict the songs that a user will listen to, given both the user's listening history and full information (including meta-data and content analysis) for all songs. 

The Million Song Dataset Challenge aims at being the best possible offline evaluation of a music recommendation system.  Any type of algorithm can be used: collaborative filtering, content-based methods, web crawling, even human oracles!* By relying on the Million Song Dataset, the data for the competition is completely open: almost everything is known and possibly available.

### Baseline: 


### Popularity 
If we have no history of the users, the recommendation system will provide a list of most popular songs.

### Content-based methods
Content-based algorithms use the set of user history to generate a prediction. These systems employ statistical techniques to find a set of users known as neighbors, who have already agreed with the active user (ie they tend to listen to a similar set of items). Once this set of users is formed, these systems use different algorithms to combine the preferences of neighbors to produce a prediction or top-N recommendation for the active user.

## Conclusion


### Further improvement: 
##### Songs title, Gene, 
##### Deep Learning
Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that achieves great power and flexibility by learning to represent the world as nested hierarchy of concepts, with each concept defined in relation to simpler concepts, and more abstract representations computed in terms of less abstract ones.
Deep learning (if we have more data), in general, deep learning can performs better if we have a lot of data. Deep learning to learn high-level features from data in an incremental manner. This eliminates the need of domain expertise and hard core feature extraction. We can use the data of SalePrice in USA, instead of one city, also include the average income, education level, etc. That may further improve the house price prediction and provide better insgiht to the buyers and invester.
